The regression output yields a more consistent analysis of the dependent variable murder. None of our independent variables that are deemed to capture a dimension of social capital attains statistical significance - not even the percentage of marriaged persons that attained statistical significance for violent and non-violent crimes (using OLS regression). The control variables indicate that higher unemployment is associated with higher levels of crime, there are (on average) fewer murders occuring in the area of former East Germany, and greater populations result in more murders. Furthermore, more heterogenous districts tend to be confronted with (on average) a greater number of murders. No further control variable attains statistical significance.  

Data and model:
- Map: we should include the map created by Daniel.
- Problems not addressed/solved in research: the aggregation level (i.e. district) might be too high to find network effect, operationalisation of social capital, reverse causality (solution: instrumental regression? panel data? individual level data?), data availability highly restricted in the field of crime in Germany 

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Final paper: Word count: 5000. 
- Correct the spelling, British English
- Rename the repository. 
- We need to update the repository and R files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.
- Citing R packages.

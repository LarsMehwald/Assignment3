To Do List until Friday, 11 December 2015:

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Correct the spelling, British English
- Rename the repository. 
- We need to update the repository and R files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.
- Citing R packages.

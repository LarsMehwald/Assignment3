To Do List until Friday, 11 December 2015:

Current word count: ~ 2000 (7/12/2015, 4pm)

Data and model:
- Categorical data: do we want to use predicted probabilities for conditional probabilities  (e.g. for East/West)?
- Operationalisation of IV: is there a better way to operationalise social capital? Number of refugee initiatives (problem: large amount of 0)? 
- Incident rates: better interpret our regression outputs, e.g. with incident rates (what is the substantial meaning of a regression result?). 
- Map: we should include the map created by Daniel.
- Problems not addressed/solved in research: the aggregation level (i.e. district) might be to high to find network effect, operationalisation of social capital, reverse causality (solution: instrumental regression? panel data? individual level data?), data availability highly restricted in the field of crime in Germany (crime data for 2013 and 2014, no coherent data for political motivated crimes in Germany)

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Final paper: We need to improve on our Assignment 3 paper and include the regression outputs. Word count: 5000. 
- We need to update the repository and R files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.

To Do List until Friday, 11 December 2015:

Current word count: ~ 4300 (11/12/2015, 6pm)

In line R commands - RMD conversion to PDF does not work when inserted - I dont know why:
`r round(mean(DistrictData$TotalPopulation * 100000), digits=3) `
`r round(coef(OLSViolent)[2], digits=2)`

Data and model:
- Map: we should include the map created by Daniel.
- Problems not addressed/solved in research: the aggregation level (i.e. district) might be too high to find network effect, operationalisation of social capital, reverse causality (solution: instrumental regression? panel data? individual level data?), data availability highly restricted in the field of crime in Germany 

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Final paper: Word count: 5000. 
- Correct the spelling, British English
- Rename the repository. 
- We need to update the repository and R files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.
- Citing R packages.

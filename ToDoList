To Do List until Friday, 11 December 2015:

Data and model:
- Categorical data: do we need/want to include a variable that is categorical (e.g. East/West) for conditional predicted probabilities? A useful alternative to the code used so far in our data files is: classes <- cut(varName, c(intervals), right = FALSE)
- Operationalisation of IV: is there a better way to operationalise social capital? Number of refugee initiatives (problem: large amount of 0)? 
- Negative binomial regression: if we use the offset possibility, then we need to change from the control variable "unemployment percentage" to "number of unemployed". 
- Indedendent variables: we need to calculate separate models for our independent variables (maybe in the end another model with all IVs included, problem: multicollinearity).
- Incident rates: better interpret our regression outputs (what is the substantial meaning?). 
- Map: we should include the map created by Daniel.
Problems not addressed/solved in research: the aggregation level (i.e. district) might be to high to find network effect, operationalisation of social capital, reverse causality (solution: instrumental regression? panel data? individual level data?), data availability highly restricted in the field of crime in Germany (crime data for 2013 and 2014, no coherent data for political motivated crimes in Germany)
- linking ALL files together (analysis, merging, scapping)
- Cite R Packages in a separate R file 

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Final paper: We need to improve on our Assignment 3 paper and include the regression outputs. Word count: 5000. 
- We need to update the repository and do files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.

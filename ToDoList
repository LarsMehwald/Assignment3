To Do List until Friday, 11 December 2015:

Current word count: ~ 3000 (10/12/2015, 10pm)

In line R commands - RMD conversion to PDF does not work when inserted - I dont know why:
`r round(mean(DistrictData$TotalPopulation * 100000), digits=3) `
`r round(coef(OLSViolent)[2], digits=2)`

British English

Data and model:
- Include discriptive statistics (tables) to the Data section.
- Map: we should include the map created by Daniel.
- Problems not addressed/solved in research: the aggregation level (i.e. district) might be too high to find network effect, operationalisation of social capital, reverse causality (solution: instrumental regression? panel data? individual level data?), data availability highly restricted in the field of crime in Germany (crime data for 2013 and 2014, no coherent data for political motivated crimes in Germany)
- Explain choice of model OLS, Poisson, quasi-poisson, negative binomial; theoretical dimension of social capital variables; rational for control vairables
- We need to version control the data that we can download from the web with SHA1 hashes (lecture 6).

Presentable output:
- Homepage: we need sinthesize our results in a reasonable manner, attract the readers attention and find some story line through our research. In order to create a homepage with GitHub, we need to have an index.html file in a new branch (with a specific name) in our repository.
- Final paper: We need to improve on our Assignment 3 paper and include the regression outputs. Word count: 5000. 
- Correct the spelling. 
- Rename the repository. 
- We need to update the repository and R files: delete files not used, comment in the readme file and so on.

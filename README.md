**Instructure:** [Christopher Gandrud](https://github.com/christophergandrud)

**Task 3:** Data collection and statistical analyses 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Work in Porgress. Please ask authors for permission before citing   

## Task to perform
In the third pair assignment you will *gather web based data* from at least two sources, *merge the data sets*, conduct *basic descriptive and inferential statistics* on the data to *address a relevant research question* and briefly *describe the results* including with dynamically generated tables and figures.  
Students are encouraged to access data and perform statistical analyses with an eye to *answering questions relevant for their Collaborative Research Project*. Deadline 13 November, the write up should be 1,500 words maximum and use literate programming, 10% of final grade.
